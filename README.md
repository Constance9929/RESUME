# Python Office Assignment
Michael and Dwight will be out of the office making a huge paper sale to Robert California. Jim and Pam decide that during this time they are going to cover all of Dwight's things in aluminum foil.

In an attempt to enhance beet farming Dwight has converted all of his things into perfect boxes. Which will make calculating the required amount of foil for each item a little easier. In order to find the amount of foil needed the surface area for each item needs to be found and then aggregated. To find the surface area the following calculation can be used:

`2*l*w + 2*h*w + 2*l*h`

To give themselves a little extra foil to work with they also need to add the surface area of the smalles side.

*For example:*

A stapler with measurement 1x10x1 needs 42 feet of foil plus 1 slack
  `2*1*1 + 2*10*1 + 2*1*10 = 42 + 1*1 = 43`
  
An office chair with measurements 11x3x7 needs xx feet of foil plus x slack
  `2*11*3 + 2*11*7 + 2*3*7 = 262 + 3*7 = 283`

Given an input file how many feet of foil will they need?
